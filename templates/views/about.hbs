    <p>Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.
        [1] On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's atmosphere, the troposphere,
        [2][3] just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.
        [4] When used without qualification, "weather" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.</p>
